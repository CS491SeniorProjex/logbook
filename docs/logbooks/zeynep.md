Model API was created using the pretrained data from the ML model. User would enter a query and 5 palettes would be returned. This API was later connected with the main page of the frontend for UI.

### 12th December - 18th December 2022
Authentication API was completed - User can register, and login which would return an Auth Token. Account API requires work using Auth Token to save the palette under certain users.

Meeting with course instructors on 24th. Helped with the understanding of the code found in a research article. Learn more on Django projects as we decided to implemet the backend using Django. Firebase and MongoDB were researched as alternative database choices. 

### 14th November - 20th November 2022
Started to learn more about project structures/framworks we can use.  Mainly worked on other backend structures like database, specifically which one to use.

### 13th November 2022
Final checks regarding the requirements report were completed.

### 12th November 2022
F2f meeting to complete diagrams for the report. I have completed the use-case diagram and the class diagram. We had an another meeting with TA in the evening to discuss the article found by Suleyman and learn more regarding the dataset he found.

- Task division was done where it was decided that I'd focus on section 3.1 and 3.2 of the requirements report. Deadline was set as 4th of November. 

### 24th October 2022
Joined the Google Colab tutorial of my ML class to learn about a possible tool to use for our project.

### 16th September - 23rd October 2022 
This section includes information on what I did before setting up the logbook.
Before Aura Palette I have also presented a viable senior project idea:
- A queue detection application in which computer vision technology would be used to estimate when a queue would end to assist the user. The initial idea was simply add this a module to an airport application so that the passenger who will go through that airport can see the crowd situation. Later this was expended to a general application.
