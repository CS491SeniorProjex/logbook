## Logbook Entries

### 16th September - 23rd October 2022 
This section includes information on what I did before setting up the logbook.
Before Aura Palette I have also presented a viable senior project idea:
- A queue detection application in which computer vision technology would be used to estimate when a queue would end to assist the user. The initial idea was simply add this a module to an airport application so that the passenger who will go through that airport can see the crowd situation. Later this was expended to a general application.
