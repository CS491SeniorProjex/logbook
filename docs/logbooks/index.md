## Contribution to the Team Project
Team-lead

### Ideas:
During team formation, I presented several ideas that included:
- DAOxi, a taxi app built with blockchain technologies
- Fake News detector.

### Recent Contribution (2nd year)
- Was responsible for handling deployment
- Finding the most optimal solution (price/characteristics/speed) for deployment
- Weekly fixing bugs that were on ML, frontend, backend sides
- Joined weekly meetings to help the group if they are stuck on something
- Helped on team organization to make sure the deadlines are met
- Bought a domain :D aurapalette.app + demo.aurapalette.app 

### General Contribution:
Since we decided to roll with The Aura Palette:
- Gave a tutorial about Blockchain 101
- Researched the machine learning field implementations for the project.
- Researched about Possible datasets to use
- Became acknowledged with technologies: PyTorch, Tensorflow.
- Took ML 101 on Youtube :)
- Set up the github organization and related repositories
- Set up the Aura Website (not design)
- Created and published the logbook
- Gave a tutorial about docesaurus (website you're browsing right now)
- Deployed front-end and back-end to two different servers: Vercel & digitalocean
- Found and worked on ML algorithms and datasets
- Fixed the ML algorithms to get appropriate results
- Assisted on front-end
- Assisted on back-end


### Some of the resources
- [Machine Learning Explained](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained)
- [Fake News algorithms](http://fakenews.research.sfu.ca/)
- [Research Paper used in our project](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04128)


[24th October - 7th November]
### Contributions:
- meeting with Haluk Tanrıkulu, ML Specialist to discuss our project idea
- meeting with Sepehr Bakhshi, talk about our project and machine learning
- Wrote my own parts in the report
- Continued my research for the academic papers we can use in our project

[8th November - 12th November]
### Contributions:
- Worked on Project Plan and Ensuring Team communication
- Helped my peers on their parts of the report
- Proof-read the report
- Had a meeting with Fazlı Hoca's TA

[13th November - 26th November]
### Contributions:
- Created a repository for the back-end application
- Helped Ayda solving async/await problem on the frontend
- Helped Zeynep with issues on the backend
- Researched how to make the algorithms for ML we found work

I decided not to write my weekly contributions because from now on there were mainly these jobs:
 - Getting meaningful results from the model (crucial)
 - Connecting the model to backend
 - Deploying everything to servers
 - Preparing a nice presentation 

 This took me a while, and since the job involved a lot of research, it would be repetitive for me to just list the tasks. The ML model we found in the research paper had some problems and was not working, so it took me almost 1-2 weeks to finally be able to solve it and get results.
