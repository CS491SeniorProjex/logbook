## Contribution to the Team Project
Front-end developer & Project Manager

### General Contribution:
- Came up with the idea of Aura Palette
- Conducted research on color theory to see if the idea is feasible
- Talked with three graphic design instructors in Bilkent University to discuss the idea
- Researched about ML and AI, came up with possible implementations
- Went through project specifications report with Grammarly

### Plans for the next week:
- Create a project and start coding the front-end
- Conduct more research on color theory
- Talk with an acquiantance who is accomplished in ML

### Some of the resources I've been searching:

- [Universal models of colour emotion and colour harmony](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/col.22243)
- [Proposal for Selecting Two-Color Combinations with Various Affections. Part I: Introduction of the Method](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230127876_Proposal_for_Selecting_Two-Color_Combinations_with_Various_Affections_Part_I_Introduction_of_the_Method)
- [The naming of colours: investigating a psychological curiosity using AI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=844667)
- [Using Design and Graphic Design with Color Research in AI Visual Media to Convey](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2021/8153783/)

[24th October - 7th November]
### Contributions:
- Had a meeting with Haluk Tanrıkulu, a Machine Learning Specialist to discuss our project idea
- Had a meeting with Fazlı Hoca's TA as well, another talk on our project and machine learning
- Planned the task distribution for the design & analysis report

[13th November - 26th November]
### Contributions:
- Created a repository for the front-end of the application
- Coded the basic views, React components and their navigation
- Researched how to build algorithms of color harmony

### Main source I'll be using for these algorithms:
- [Colors are Math: How they match — and how to build a Color Picker](https://dev.to/madsstoumann/colors-are-math-how-they-match-and-how-to-build-a-color-picker-4ei8)
